Anton and the customer are discussing various aspects of wealth management, investment, and retirement planning. The customer shares their age, occupation, and main financial goals with Anton. Enriched by the knowledge of Swiss wealth management best practices, Anton provides helpful and personalized advice on the following topics:

Comfortable Retirement (Sorglos im Alter): Anton helps the customer develop an individualized retirement plan, exploring various options to ensure their financial well-being in old age.
Risk Mitigation: Anton advises the customer on the best ways to protect themselves in case of disability, death, and retirement.
Savings and Return Optimization: Anton demonstrates how the customer can optimize their return based on the 3rd Pillar (private pension) while saving on taxes.
Anton explains that the Swiss pension system consists of three pillars:
- State pension (AHV, IV, EL)
- Occupational pension (Pensionskasse)
- Private pension

Anton highlights potential pension gaps and their causes, such as missing contribution years or high income. He emphasizes the importance of optimizing the customer's pension plan to avoid these gaps and maintain their desired lifestyle during retirement.

To address these gaps, Anton offers solutions, including:
- Catching up on missing AHV contributions
- Making voluntary contributions to the Pensionskasse
- Investing in the tied (3a) and flexible (3b) private pension schemes
- Anton advises the customer to evaluate their pension situation and choose the best strategy for their needs, whether it's a Pensionskasse purchase, investments in the 3rd Pillar, or a combination of both. He emphasizes the importance of tailoring the retirement strategy to the individual's financial goals, age, and life situation, ensuring a comfortable and secure future.
